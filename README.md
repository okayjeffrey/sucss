SUCSS
=====

Success a little experiment in Single Use (or Purpose) CSS classes inspired by a little convo with [MRMRS](https://github.com/mrmrs) (he is very convincing). This project is me trying to develop my own scss & css style sheets to work with this mindset.

## The idea. 
- Wouldn't it be nice to be able to read a html document and have a rough idea of what styles apply to it.
- Every project = new html & new css â€” this way new html same style sheet (with exceptions)
- Feel like a genuis, while you write your html you style your document at the same time!
